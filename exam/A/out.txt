Ordinary differential equations:
Here equations have been solved by using the new implemented two-step method. The first step is made by the one-step method knonw as Runge-Kutta(RK45).
Test have been mad to compare the two-step method with the one-step method.
Test 1: y''=-y. Here the one-step method used 1205 iterations and the two-step method used 315.
Test 2: y''+b*y'+c*sin(y)=0. Here the one-step method used 13322 iterations and the two-step method used 784.
Test 3: y''-b*y'-c*cos(y)=0. Here the one-step method used 5901 iterations and the two-step method used 732.
See the figures(test1.pdf, test2.pdf and test3.pdf) for visuel comparison.
