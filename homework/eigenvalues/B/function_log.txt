Investigation of convergance of energies with respect to rmax.
The spacing dr is fixed(0.2 Borh) and rmax is from 2 to 30.
The three lowest energies(eigenvalues), using Jacob EVD, will be kompared to analytical values.
See plot rmax.pdf
The three lowest eigenvalues converge.

Investigation of convergance of energies with respect to npoints.
npoints goes from 10 to 200
See plot npoints.pdf
The three lowest eigenvalues converget

Evaluation of the lowest eigenfunctions
The parameters are rmax=30, npoints=200 and dr=0.2
