The implemented minimization function from part A is used to investigate the Higgs boson
The Breit-Wigner function is fitted, by minimizing the fit function
x0=       120          3          6 
The initial guess is (120, 3, 6)
From the algoritm:

	Mass = 125,972188019989
	Width = 2,08634033456889
	Amplitude = 9,87626105857404
