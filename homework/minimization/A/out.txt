Test function f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100*(y-x^2)^2
Finding the minimum of the function
Start guess (0,0)
The minimum was found at (0,999984642801962,0,999969232181272)
Here f(x,y) = 2,36131454998171E-10
There is one minimum at (1,1), for f(x,y)=0


Test function f(x,y)=(x^2+y-11)^2+(x+y^2-7)^2
Finding the minimum of the function
Start guess (1,1)
The minimum was found at (2,99999987176844,2,00000015119024)
Here f(x,y) = 6,09250418581111E-13
There is one minimum at (3,2), for f(x,y)=0
