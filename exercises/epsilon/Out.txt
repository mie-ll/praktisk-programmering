Exercise 1:
my max int = 2147483647
System max int = 2147483647 
my min int = -2147483648
System min int = -2147483648
Exercise 2:
The machine epsilon for double = 2,22044604925031E-16
The machine epsilon for float = 1,192093E-07
Exercise 3:
sumA-1 = 0,000000e+000 should be 1,110223e-010
sumB-1 = 1,110223e-010 should be 1,110223e-010
Exercise 4:
a = 2E-09, b = 1,5E-09 and |a-b|<1e-9 should be True and it is True
